# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This repository contains Python scripts to classify news articles as real or fake using various machine learning models. It preprocesses textual data, applies TF-IDF vectorization, and deploys multiple classifiers for prediction.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install nltk dependencies using:
```bash
pip install nltk
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/fake-news-detection.git
   cd fake-news-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Dataset:**
   - Ensure your dataset (`train_fake.csv`) is in the root directory.

4. **Run the code:**
   - Execute `fake_news_detection.py` to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

5. **Models Evaluated:**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Random Forest
   - Decision Tree

## Results

- The accuracy scores of each model on the test set are displayed.
- Confusion matrices and classification reports are visualized to evaluate model performance.
